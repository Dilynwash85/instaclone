# Sample configuration for Instacloning node_modules.
# Just copy this file next to your Node project root, modify it as desired, and check it into Git.
# You need to "pip install s4cmd" and configure ~/.s3cfg with your credentials for S3 for this to work.
# Thereafter, anyone can "instaclone publish" or "instaclone install" from that directory.
# With this config, the final files will be in S3 at locations like:
#   s3://my-s3-bucket/instaclone/my-project/my-app/node_modules.$xxxx-yyyy$/node_modules.zip
# (where xxxx is a SHA1 hash and yyyy is the platform).
items:
  - local_path: node_modules
    remote_path: my-app
    remote_prefix: s3://my-s3-bucket/instaclone/my-project
    # These commands are called to upload and download the archived directory:
    upload_command: s4cmd put -f $LOCAL $REMOTE
    download_command: s4cmd get $REMOTE $LOCAL
    # The "version" is a hash of the shrinkwrap file followed by the platform we're on
    # (e.g. Linux or Darwin, which we determine by calling "uname").
    version_hashable: npm-shrinkwrap.json
    version_command: uname
